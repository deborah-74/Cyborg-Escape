## Cyborg Escape

This is an immersive virtual reality experience created in _Alternate Realities_, a class taught by Professor Michael Allison. For this project, I created an immersive narrative set in a post-apocalyptic future where the world has been taken over by evil, totalitarian cyborgs. Throughout the experience, the player must complete a set of tasks that will help restore power back to the human race.

## Story Breakdown

You have been locked in prison due to treasonous crimes against the government. Set hundreds of years into the future, the world has been taken over by cyborgs who now rule over humanity. Humans are at the bottom of the hierarchy, forced to do nothing but stay in their homes and follow the rules of the government. You were the leader of the rebel group, Sapiens, who were leading a coup against the government to drive the cyborgs out of society and restore power back to your fellow humans. Your plan was mysteriously revealed to the government, which has now landed you in prison, for life! You have not lost all hope though. You are determined to escape prison and continue your rebellion against the cyborgs, and end their dictatorship once and for all!

### Beginning

The user begins the experience in a lobby, which is the headquarters of the main character's anti-cyborg rebel group, called the Sapiens. They must make their way towards the exit, where they will have their hand scanned and then enter the second scene - a prison. In this scene, they will be locked in a cell and must find a way to escape. Spoiler - there's a pipe that can be used to create a hole in one of the walls!

### Middle

After the user successfully creates a hole in the wall, they will enter a tunnel which will take them to the third scene, which is set in a city near the cyborg headquarters. The user must navigate through the city, which is constructed like a maze, in order to find the headquarters which is behind an electric fence. Once they disconnect the fence from power, they can enter the headquarters.

### Ending

Once in the headquarters, the player must press the 'kill button' which will destroy all the cyborgs. The user can also pick up a green tool that they can use to destroy the servers in the console room. Once this is done, they will transition to the last scene during which a news video will be played to report the success of the revolution.
