## Cyborg Escape

This is an immersive virtual reality experience created in _Alternate Realities_, a class taught by Professor Michael Allison. For this project, I created an immersive narrative set in a post-apocalyptic future where the world has been taken over by evil, totalitarian cyborgs. Throughout the experience, the player must complete a set of tasks that will help restore power back to the human race.

## Story Breakdown

You have been locked in prison due to treasonous crimes against the government. Set hundreds of years into the future, the world has been taken over by cyborgs who now rule over humanity. Humans are at the bottom of the hierarchy, forced to do nothing but stay in their homes and follow the rules of the government. You were the leader of the rebel group, Sapiens, who were leading a coup against the government to drive the cyborgs out of society and restore power back to your fellow humans. Your plan was mysteriously revealed to the government, which has now landed you in prison, for life! You have not lost all hope though. You are determined to escape prison and continue your rebellion against the cyborgs, and end their dictatorship once and for all!

### Beginning

The user begins the experience in a lobby, which is the headquarters of the main character's anti-cyborg rebel group, called the Sapiens. They must make their way towards the exit, where they will have their hand scanned and then enter the second scene - a prison. In this scene, they will be locked in a cell and must find a way to escape. Spoiler - there's a pipe that can be used to create a hole in one of the walls!

### Middle

After the user successfully creates a hole in the wall, they will enter a tunnel which will take them to the third scene, which is set in a city near the cyborg headquarters. The user must navigate through the city, which is constructed like a maze, in order to find the headquarters which is behind an electric fence. Once they disconnect the fence from power, they can enter the headquarters.

### Ending

Once in the headquarters, the player must press the 'kill button' which will destroy all the cyborgs. The user can also pick up a green tool that they can use to destroy the servers in the console room. Once this is done, they will transition to the last scene during which a news video will be played to report the success of the revolution.

## Interactions

There are four types of interactions in this virtual reality experience, and they are as follows:

- Direct interactions: for picking objects up and colliding objects with other objects
- Ray interactions: for teleportation and for sending raycasts that will detect the player
- Socket interaction: for a plug in the city scene
- Button interaction: for the 'kill button' in the console room scene

All these different interactions tie the story together and make the experience much more interactive and immersive than it would have been if the user was just being told the story. It was important for me to include various types of interactions so that the experience would not feel repetitive.

## Sounds

A number of different sounds were used throughout this experience, including the following:

- Mystery/ sci-fi background music that will be persistent throughout all scenes
- Inner monologue of main character
- Speech for the robots
- Dialogue between main character (Simon Smith) and another character (Janet)
- Sound effects: bricks falling, server breaking, electricity, static noise etc.
- Game over sound that plays whenever player is detected by player/ cyborg

The dialogue was a very useful tool to help drive the narrative, and to also guide the users through the different tasks that they had to complete. For example, after a certain amount of time, if the user hadn't found the pipe in the toilet, the player would say something like "hmm, maybe I should take a look inside the toilet and see if I can find something". This way, more agency was given to the user than they would have gotten if there were instructions telling them what to do. 

The background music also helped to set the scene, and because it was persistent throughout all the scenes, it tied the whole story together and maintained continuity. Apart from the background music and the monologue/ dialogue, sound effects were also an integral part of making the story more immersive. In a way, they reinforce the player's actions by reminding them that their interactions have an effect on the storyworld. For example, the bricks falling sounds made the action seem more realistic.

## Animations

Several animations were used to drive the narrative. From the character animations to animations of game objects within the scene such as the XR rig and so on, animations were an essential part of the overall storytelling. Here is a list of all the animations throughout this experience:

- In the prison scene, the XR rig is animated to move and rotate the player towards their prison cell
- After a hole is created in the wall, the XR rig is once again animated to move through the tunnel (though I ended up changing this from an animation to a script in order to make things run and look smoother)
- In the city scene, the cameras + spotlights are animated to rotate, to give the illusion that they are surveilling the area
- The cyborgs are animated to walk around the scenes with their rifle, and turn when necessary
